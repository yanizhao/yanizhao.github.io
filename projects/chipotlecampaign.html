        <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>On 10.31, it reported that E. coli sickened at least 22 people who ate at Chipotle in Oregon and Washington. Up to now, E. coli linked to Chipotle spreads to 6 States and sickens more than 40 people. However, Chipotle could not find the source of sickness. The outbreak of E. coli damaged the reputation of Chipotle and lead to the decline of its stock.</p>

          <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Primary audience: current customers of Chipotle</li>
              <li>Secondary audience: : potential customers of Chipotle, the customer of Chipotle’s competitions</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>Research Plan</h2>
            <article>
            <h3>Interview with current customers</h3>
              <p>Ask employees to do a short interview in every restaurant until the problem will be solved, especially on the six states where E. coli appeared. If the people would like to accept the interview, they can get $10 off coupon. </p>
              <p>Interview Question: How do they think Chipotle previously? How do they think about the outbreak of E. coli in Chipotle? Do they change their attitude after the outbreak of E. coli? What do they think about the actions Chipotle take after E. coli happened? Why do they still want to eat at Chipotle? Do they have some suggestions about Chipotle or this event?</p>
              <p>The purpose of interview is to identify the influence of this event on Chipotle current customers, and if they change their attitude. From the interview, we also need to gather information about Chipotle’s advantages.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
            <h3>Interview with former customers</h3>
              <p>The “former customers” here means the customers who stop eating at Chipotle after the outbreak of E. coli. I think phone interview is the best way for former customers. In this section, I hope get information as much as possible until receiving many similar answers. Interview questions as follows: Why do they stop going to Chipotle? How do they think about the outbreak of E. coli? Do they still want to go to Chipotle after solving the problem? Why? Are they satisfied with the actions Chipotle take for the E. coli? Do they change their attitude to Chipotle after the outbreak of E. coli?</p>
              <p>From the interview with former customers, I want to know why these people choose to stop working with Chipotle.  What the influence did the E. coli event have on Chipotle? How can PR play a role in addressing those issues?</p>
            </article>

            <article>
            <h3>Surveys</h3>
              <p>Conduct an online survey by email or URL with all customers. Anyone who does the survey can get $10 off coupon. The survey should focus on four aspects:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Do they change their attitude to Chipotle after E. coli happens?</li>
                  <li>How do they think of the outbreak of E. coli? </li>
                  <li>Are they satisfied with Chipotle’s action to the E. coli event? </li>
                  <li>Do they have any suggestions to Chipotle?</li>
                </ol>
            </article>

            <article>
            <h3>Online Observation</h3>
              <p>From the online conversation, I want to gather information about how often people talking about Chipotle and whether the comments are negative or positive.</p>
            </article>
        </section>


          <section>
            <h2>Key Message</h2>
            <p>Chipotle is responsible and gives the highest priority to customers’ safety and wellbeing.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Media Strategies</h2>
              <ol>
                <li>In order to correct inaccurate and incomplete information, we need to update the latest information about E. coli event on different social media platforms. The information from Chipotle is more credible than other sources.</li>
                <li>To persuade customers to go to Chipotle, we also need to highlight advantages of Chipotle. We can utilize multimedia to advertise. We also need to ask our spokesperson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, to advertise for Chipotle.</li>
              	<li>Arnold Schwarzenegger is supposed to give speeches and accept interviews on different media platforms.</li>
              </ol>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Other Strategies</h2>
              <ol>
                <li>Try our best to prevent the spread of E. coli and investigate the source of E. coli. This action can not only prevent the panic, but also can increase the credibility of E. coli.</li>
                <li>Emphasize that Chipotle is responsible for any issues happened, and highly regards customers’ health.</li>
                <li>Communicate and discuss the matter to and with all staff, and encourage their support and cooperation. Let the staff know if they are approached by third parties to discuss the incident, they should direct them to the designated contact persons. And ask their employees to execute the plan and policy that the Chipotle regulates.</li>
              </ol>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Media Tactics</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Update the latest information on Chipotle website in everyday, such as the number for sickness, the process of investigation, what Chipotle is doing for the outbreak of E. coli and so on.</li>
                <li>Update the result of investigation on social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest and some blogs. </li>
                <li>Reply to customers on social media immediately. Forward the positive comments. For those negative comments, promise to improve.</li>
                <li>Send emails to customer to inform them about what happened.</li>
                <li>Hold news conference to apologize for the issue.</li>
                <li>Release an open letter for apologizing for the issue on website, Facebook, Twitter, and Google+.</li>

                <li>Invite Arnold Schwarzenegger to eat at Chipotle and record it with video. Forward the video on YouTube.</li>
                <li>Publish news releases everyday on website and invite media to use these media releases. </li>
                <li>Make two brochures. One of them is about how to prevent E. coli. Another is an advertisement for Chipotle. Send them to customers’ mailbox. And we also post them on website.</li>
                <li>Add more advertisements of Chipotle on different websites, TV stations and radio channels. </li>
                <li>Post some food pictures, interesting food making videos on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Pinterest, and Google+ to obtain more customers. </li>
                <li>Let Arnold Schwarzenegger accept interviews with newspaper, magazines, TV, and networking programs. He should discuss with publics that Chipotle is responsible for the issue and takes many actions for it. He also needs to give TV speeches with the same content. And forward these speech and interview videos on YouTube.</li>
              </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Tactics</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Stop the production of victims and close the restaurant in six states where E. coli happened.</li>
                <li>Contact Chipotle’s attorney immediately. The attorney can provide advice and representation initially。</li>
                <li>Contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Washington State Department of Health and the Oregon Health Authority to investigate the outbreak of E. coli. If these health department officials contact Chipotle first, treat them as a partner. Do not attempt to evade questions or hide facts relevant to food safety issues.</li>
                <li>Hire food safety consulting firms to assist with the investigation.  The firm might be able to serve as an expert witness on Chipotle’s behalf and assess and improve upon its already high standards for food safety.</li>
                <li>Conduct Chipotle’s own investigation, even if the health department is conducting its own, to determine the source of the E. coli. It includes inspecting the products and procedures, and interviewing all food-handling staff on duty during the day of the E. coli outbreak.</li>
                <li>Invite media to report the process of investigation. Reveal how they investigate the source of illness and spread it to publics. </li>
                <li>Invite customers to visit Chipotle’s workshops and get suggestions form them.</li>
                <li>Contact the supplier if necessary. If the E. coli might be related to a vendor’s product, we should notify the distributor and/or supplier immediately.</li>
                <li>The spokesperson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, needs to insist that the safety and wellbeing of customers is always Chipotle’s highest priority. And he needs to announce detailed steps about how to improve the food safety, such as get rid of and replace all produce, do a deep cleaning of restaurants, pass a local health inspection, start a new protocol for cleaning produce and discard food in time and so on. We can post the food safety improving plan in every restaurant to let customers know what we are doing. Write news release to spread the plan. Make a video to show how employees execute this plan, and spread it on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter. </li>
                <li>Place representatives from Chipotle at each hospital, perhaps even with each affected family. Promise to arrange for handling victim expenses. This will show the families of those infected that Chipotle is concerned about their well-being and recovery. It also will give publics a good impression that Chipotle is responsible for the issue. Make sure the representatives know that their roles are the public relations one. They should not make promises or admit any liability that might later come back to haunt Chipotle in court. Invite media to follow the representatives and record when they go to the hospital. </li>
                <li>Communicate internally as soon as possible. Prevent them from spreading enormous uninformed communication. Encourage the staff to support Chipotle and have confidence to pull through. Ask them to execute the food safety improving plan carefully. All staff should be trained to respond to inquiries about the outbreak. Whenever they are approached by third parties to discuss the incident, they should direct them to the designated contact persons. However, they need to be polite and show their sympathy to the victims.</li>
              </ul>
