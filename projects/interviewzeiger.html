        <h3>Mr. Zeiger with his understanding of Reputation</h3>
        <p>A reputation framework shows that after customers, communities, investors, and employees perceive a corporate identity, including names, brans, symbol, and self-presentations, the sum of their perception equals the corporate reputation. According to the Hill &amp; Knowlton Corporate Reputation Watch survey, almost all analysts agree that if a company fails to look after reputational aspects of its performance, then it will ultimately suffer financially. In response to this demand, many public relations firms and consultancies now offer reputation measurement and management services to their corporate clients. Rob Zeiger has plenty experience of how to manage the reputation for the company. He states the members of the leadership team all have a good sense about how to do for reputation and have skilled diversified corporation management methods. However, he admits it is very hard to measure the reputation. In Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd, Mr. Zeiger mentions they do surveys with informed observers to know how well doing, what they think about the company and how they think of the reputation. Beside the survey, the company has a more convenient way to know how customers feel about the company. All customers would receive a card to tell the employees how the trip with them and give a score to the trip. No matter if it was too much noise at the pool or the restaurant did not perform very well, customers can always tell the employees. And the company also has an outsider side, named cruisecritic.com. Form this website, customers can look up any ship, and the ship can be rated by hundreds of past guests. Based on the customer’s evaluation and identify to the Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd., Therefore, it is convenience for Mr. Zeiger and his teams to know whether the reputation of their corporation is positive or negative.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zeiger believes that corporations are very unlikely to receive the clients’ opinion in general cases. For most of the company, it displays a successful sign if there are more than 5000 Facebook followers or 2000 Twitter followers. Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd. has an enormous advantage in this aspect. Because people for vacation are very passionate, therefore, thousands of participants would like to post pictures on social media platforms, such as food and sunset. They talk about their vacation on media, no matter if it is wonderful or terrible, so there is a big discussion about the company at any time. And at the same time, employees can estimate how well they are doing according to the content that the customers posted.</p>
        <p>“Consumers don’t think us as a corporation, but just think the experience in ships, which equals to the corporation.” Mr. Zeiger indicates that they hold focus groups with government regulators, who are very serious people. These people in focus group don’t want to talk about corporation, but just want to talk about ships.</p>
        <p>“Not only customers’ post the cruise experience on social media, staff of Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd. also likes to do so.” said Mr. Zeiger. There are 16000 employees in the company from all over the world. And the young staff prefers to post work experience on Facebook, Twitter; therefore, employees also helping to disseminate the company. </p>
        <p>Mr. Zeiger thinks that in current society, keeping reputation is harder, but people have better equipment. For Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd., if people do the job right, it can be easier for company to keep reputation, because people share wonderful experience. But if something goes wrong, it will be hard to redeem it, since thousands of people on the ship will easily generate negative impacts through social media, and they all are reporters. If any unexpected incidents happened, all teams for corporate communication have to move quickly to respond, and to control the impact.</p>
        <p>Proactivity and transparency are the two primary strategies for Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd. to maintain the reputation. Mr. Zeiger illustrates comparing to the past few years they have been acting more proactively. Moreover, it is crucial to be entirely transparent for a corporation. The corporation is transparent on internal communication because Mr. Zeiger believes that in the company, no one is more influential than people who work there. One example is given, if an employee connected 300 friends on social media, anything he positively posts related to the company will easily convinces the public to trust it, which giving an affirmative reputation support to the company. People who received the information are very like to have a positive impression of the company in their mind. As in result, to be internal transparent is not only helping their employees to understand every made decision, but also, more importantly, is supporting the reputation for the entire corporation. Therefore, Mr. Zeiger insists that transparency is the principle for Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd., employees able to understand what their leaders are doing.</p>
        <p>To be external transparent is another principle in Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd. However, Mr. Zeiger indicates that external transparent does not means informative unlimited, every answers that each employee provides should strictly follow the law that lawyers suggested. Due to the understanding of external transparent that Mr. Zeiger provides, they have to publish every message no matter it is positive or negative; for good message, they want to tell the story and like to communicate to the public; for bad one, they also have to communicate. So, if a crisis happens, the team should twitter as fast as they can, as frequently as they need, and as openly as possible. Mr. Zeiger mentions that the first photo for the fire crisis is posted by his team on Twitter. In conclusion, transparency and insisting facts are fundamental for Mr. Zeiger and his teams to retain reputation for the corporation.</p>

        <h3>Corporate Character</h3>
        <p>Corporate character describes the unique identity that distinguishes each enterprise — the characteristics that define its very nature. This identity begins with purpose and values, but is lived out through actions that are carried out consistently in the company’s strategy and operating plans.Roger Bolton, the President of Arthur W. Page Society, talked to us on the class of corporate communication that mission, purpose, values, culture, strategy, business model, and brand are all included in corporate character. In the interview, Mr. Zeiger tells the Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd.’s character.</p>
        <p>For the mission, Mr. Zeiger emphasizes defining the mission is complex. He refers an interesting story based on defining the mission. To truly understand the meaning of each word, the CEO and Mr. Zeiger literally went to a dictionary, and looked up the meaning of individual words to make sure that the exact meaning of the word is corresponding to what they want. Following the principle of corporate communication, Mr. Zeiger also agrees that in every 5 years, companies should consider whether it is necessary to update the mission. Moreover, Mr. Zeiger is confident on believing every Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. employee understands the mission, vision, and values of the company; however, the reason that every employee knows the principles of company well is not because they activity learn it during communication, but is following a strong coaches which Mr. Zeiger feels a little depress on it. Follow his opinion, to learn the principles of company through communication or through a strong coaches will be very different, even though, the fact is that it is very difficult to have chances to communicate with every employee. He admits they don’t do the job as good as what they should do on creating the conversation with employees about the company’s mission, vision, and values.</p>
        <p>For the corporate culture, the CEO of Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd. tells the company that they have culture continue to prove. “Samequanon”, which means without something, there is nothing. For the cruise company, without safety, they get nothing. Therefore, safety is fundamental in Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd. Stakeholders will receive information easily about corporate character as Mr. Zeiger considers. He and his teams launch a corporate website, people, such as academics, students, NGOs, regulators, investors, who might have deep questions about how the corporation runs and events, can find the related information through the webpage. Another purpose for this website is to spread the fact. “Transparency is beneficial to company. We show many things because we have confidence on them.” Mr. Zeiger also regards transparency as a fully deeper culture for the company.</p>

        <h3>Corporate Social Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>Corporate responsibility (often referred to as corporate social responsibility), corporate citizenship, sustainability, and even conscious capitalism are some of the terms bandied about in the news media and corporate marketing efforts as companies jockey to win the trust and loyalty of constituents around the world. An increasingly significant contributor to corporate reputation is the notion of corporate responsibility (CR), which is a corporation’s social and environmental obligations to its constituencies and greater society. </p>
        <p>Mr. Zeiger mentions that <abbr title="Corporate Social Responsibilities">CSR</abbr> has to do good for the world. <abbr title="Corporate Social Responsibilities">CSR</abbr> is important to the corporation, not only because it is beneficial to the reputation of companies, but also obtains customers.  Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd. has its own <abbr title="Corporate Social Responsibilities">CSR</abbr> plan. Mr. Zeiger points that their <abbr title="Corporate Social Responsibilities">CSR</abbr> strategy is similar to what Starbucks did before. Many people criticize that Starbucks might kills many trees for the papers and cups. The faith of Starbucks is telling the true “We sustainable for the paper and cups, and worked with farmer to replant their farmlands”. Therefore, every questions that consumers are worried about had been gone. Mr. Zeiger indicates that customers for Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd. are worried about the ship’s pollution. Therefore, they have great stories to tell the customers and be transparent. “If we tell people that we do environmentally, we do great and will be impressed.” Mr. Zeiger said.</p>

        <h3>Media Relations</h3>
        <p>Mr. Zeiger expresses that good media relation not only delivery message; but also understanding what media wants, and figure out how the message dresses instruct is what Mr. Zeiger considers good media relations is. Therefore to some extends, it is the bridge building.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zeiger indicates the challenge they are facing is how to make sure the story that the reporter delivery to the public is the same meaning as what they want, and how to get cross the message safety, how to make customers happy. He admits that it might not be easy, but it does work.</p>
        <p>In his opinion, the best way to uphold the ongoing media relationships is to talk to the media whether the new is good or bad, and continually dialogs with reporters. It is not the right way that only talk to the reporters when in the situation that they need them. No matter the company has good news or bad information, they have to pass the message to the media. Therefore, Mr. Zeiger says they have the habit that talking to the media in the earlier day. And media says “we respect you.”</p>
        <p>Certainly, there are some negative reports for the company. Mr. Zeiger cites an instance to describe the solution. “If you have a gossip, but people know who you are, so they don’t believe the gossip. Every time they call us about the negative information for us, they always believe the answer we say. That’s a good media relationship’s influence.”</p>

        <h3>Internal Communication</h3>
        <p>More recently, people have begun to dedicate kind of attention to their own employees, recognizing that employees have more to do with the success of a business than virtually any other constituency. </p>
        <p>Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd. also pays great attention on internal communication. Since there are only a few people in the company can have the chances to learn everything that is going on in each separated departments; therefore Mr. Zeiger expects to make sure behalf manner of employees. In the corporate communication group, the team member try to know as much information as what’s going on in the company as possible; and the <abbr title="Chief Communication Officer">CCO</abbr> can contact all the brand, senior managements, to know what’s going wrong and what ‘s coming up next. Moreover, it is improbable for the employee who is holding more than one job duties to know everything that company is working on. “Nobody knows anything.” Therefore, Mr. Zeiger indicates that they should follow the same strategy as media does; announce the information that employees are required to know for every day, as well as the information they like to know. From the internal communication, leaders have to recognize what employees are thinking.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zeiger states that they take regular measurement among employees, and execute the measurement several times a year. They do the survey to test whether their staff feels happy or not, and what their thoughts. But he says that they don’t fell communication management does very well, so they are trying to fix it. From the feedback of survey, employees think the leader in the company lead to a good direction, and give scores well. Mr. Zeiger indicates that they are trying to do more and more for internal communication. The first thing is to make the meeting more engaging and more fun. The second step that the company adopts is to produce one page summary and share with all employees. They will show the video about what they talk about every day, and people can click and watch it.</p>

        <h3>Internal Communication</h3>
        <p>Today, because of the increasingly digital makeup of the media and the ever present social networking community, a breaking corporate crisis is likely to be reported within minutes by interested individuals via social networks such as Twitter and Facebook. The news will then be reported by bloggers and, of course, by traditional media organizations on their websites as well. Thus, a more sophisticated media environment, as well as a new emphasis on technology in business, has created the need for a more sophisticated response to crises. With personal computers, the Internet, and smart phones now integral parts of the fabric of business, organizations face new challenges and the potential for crises that they have not dealt with before.</p>
        <p>It is easier for publics to find what is wrong for the cruise company if people post the ship on the <abbr title="television">TV</abbr>. Therefore, corporate communication team should be very serious on how to respond a crisis. Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd. has a brand new inspect room, where crisis respond here is different from many other companies. When the crisis happens, working groups from different departments come to the room. The screen in the room have 5 desperate sources, therefore people can be looking at the situation. They can see weather map in the room and tell the locations of all ships in the area of incident, so other ships can help. And in the room, people can have video chat, and talk with capital. Some people in the team are able to figure out how to solve the machine problems. In the intense, the team for crisis can be at the room for days, and different departments respond to different things. Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd. has a perfect system to any crisis.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zeiger indicates that the primary audience in the crisis is the family members of people who are on the ship. He mentions that besides the safety, the more important thing for the company is to provide primary audience the complete information and answers. Therefore, it is a challenge to give the accurate information as soon as possible; indeed, it means they have to be provide the true information since they are the only source from. And Mr. Zeiger thinks of that if they can get the fact correct and fast, then they can do everything they want to do, and media are able to report accurately. In many different social media platforms, Mr. Zeiger and his teams choose Twitter as the main platform to spread information. Anytime when people call them and want more information, the team would tell these people that go to the Twitter, and there is most credible information they want to know on Twitter.</p>

        <h3>Relationship with C-suite members</h3>
        <p>Mr. Zeiger thinks highly of the <abbr title="Chief executive officer">CEO</abbr>, Richard D. Fain. He mentions that Mr. Fain has a profound understanding of the company, and has one of the best knowledge of <abbr title="Public Relations">PR</abbr>, <abbr title="Corporate Social Responsibilities">CSR</abbr>. If the <abbr title="Chief executive officer">CEO</abbr> can understand corporate communication, <abbr title="Chief Communication Officer">CCOs</abbr> can talk with <abbr title="Chief executive officer">CEOs</abbr> together about something they both know and what they want to do. </p>
